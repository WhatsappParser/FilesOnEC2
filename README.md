### About
This repo contains other cruicial files that were needed for deployment on EC2 server. It is to note that 
both the frontend and backend are deployed on same EC2 instance. I made use of Nginx as a http server
and also a reverse-proxy for the requests. 

### default
This file is at location /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.
<br>
It contains necessary stuff for proper function of Nginx and reverse proxy info.

### springboot.service
This file is present at location /etc/systemd/system
<br>
Meaning this is a custom systemd service. This runs the backend and also stores the output logs appropriately.

### MakeConf.sh
Used to create a file India_ips.conf. That file contains all the IP subnets that belong to India. 
It is used with nginx to allow only IP addresses part of it to access the site. Did this because of bots
sending too many HTTP requests to the server. As most bots I have seen were from foreign countries. You can
observe that it takes as input Indian_ips.txt, this file is generated by a simple wget.

    wget -O India_ips.txt https://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/data/countries/in.zone

### default - of sites-enabled
Present at /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default. It has the logic of disallowing foreign IP addresses by making 
use of India_ips.conf generated by previous shell script.
